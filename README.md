A Russian Roulette game implemented in C# would involve creating a simple console application that simulates the dangerous game of chance involving a revolver with a single bullet in its cylinder. The game is played by spinning the cylinder, thus randomly placing the bullet in one of the chamber positions, and then "firing" the gun at one's own head. In a software version, no real danger is involved, and the outcome is determined by random number generation to simulate the chance element of the game.
